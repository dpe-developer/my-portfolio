## How It Works

1. **Patient Registration & Record Creation**: A new patient is registered in the system by entering personal details, medical history, and insurance information. Existing patients have their records retrieved from the database.
2. **Appointment Scheduling**: Books appointments with doctors, specialists, and other healthcare providers.
3. **Consultation**: The doctor accesses the patient's medical history and current complaints. Consultation details, diagnosis, prescriptions, and recommended tests are recorded.
4. **Admission**: Admitting the patient to a ward or room, and assign a bed and managing bed availability.
5. **Discharge**: Preparing a summary of the patientâ€™s stay, including diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up instructions.
6. **Prescription**: The doctor generates an e-prescription, which can be sent directly to a pharmacy.
7. **Billing**: Generating bills for consultations, tests, procedures, medications, and hospital stays.
