This is a patient management app for clinics. Designed to streamline healthcare processes by efficiently managing patient information, medical records, and appointments. It enhances operational efficiency, reduces administrative workload, and improves patient care.

## Features

- **Patient Registration & Records**: Stores detailed patient information, including personal details, medical history, and treatment records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Book, reschedule, and track patient appointments.
- **Electronic Medical Records (EMR)**: Digital storage of medical history, prescriptions, and diagnoses for easy access.
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Generate reports on patient visits, and medical records.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with **Bootstrap** and **JQuery** for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: **Laravel** for handling server-side logic and APIs.
- **Database**: **MySQL** for storing patient records and appointments.


## How It Works

1. **Appointment Scheduling**: Patients can book, reschedule, or cancel appointments online or through staff.
2. **Patient Registration & Record Creation**: A new patient is registered in the system by entering personal details, medical history, and insurance information. Existing patients have their records retrieved from the database.
3. **Check-In & Consultation**: The doctor accesses the patient's medical history and current complaints. Consultation details, diagnosis, prescriptions, and recommended tests are recorded.
4. **Prescription**: The doctor generates an e-prescription, which can be sent directly to a pharmacy.
