This is a social app for food lovers where users can post, share, and discover recipes from around the world. I built this app to combine my passion for food and technology, creating a platform where people can connect and share their culinary creations. The project allowed me to work on both front-end and back-end development, enhancing my full-stack development skills.

- **Recipe Cost Breakdown**: Display a detailed breakdown of costs per ingredient.
- **Portion Costing**: Calculate the cost per serving or portion.
- **Recipe Scaling**: Scale recipes up or down to adjust for different batch sizes.
